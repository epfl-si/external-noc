# iDev-FSD external NOC

# About

This project aims to set up a Network Operations Center (so called
[NOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center)) providing an
external monitoring for our School. In short, it will set up
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Prometheus
Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/), [Prometheus
Blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter), [Prometheus
Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/), [Prometheus
Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and
[Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) on a server, using
docker containers and deployed with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). On top
of that, [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy / load balancer handle the
HTTP requests.

# Pre-requisites

We assume that the NOC will be deployed on a Ubuntu server, on which you can
access with your SSH key with the root rights.

## Installation

The installation is self-managed by the `nocsible` script, which will download
the [Ansible suitcase](https://github.com/epfl-si/ansible.suitcase/) if needed.
This will ensure that every member of the team will be using the same versions
of the tools such as python, pip module, ansible modules, ruby, etc.

## Keybase

The secrets in this project are stored on a static yaml file on the team's 
keybase (`/keybase/team/epfl_idevfsd/idevfsd-NOC/ansible_noc_secrets.yml`). An 
Ansible file lookup will get them, meaning that access to this file is mandatory 
and that it has to be mounted.

# Deployment

In our case, the deployment in done on a virtual machine hosted on a OpenStack
setup by [SWITCHEngines](https://www.switch.ch/engines/). Thus, some of the
explanations might be related to that, more particularly the access rules which
depends on [OpenStack Neutron Security
Groups](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/SecurityGroups).

# Project's bricks

Each bricks of the project is meant to be self-contained. It should be possible
to deploy each brick individually, using Ansible tags.
